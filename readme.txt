Multitasking made easy. WindowPress turns your wp-admin into a desktop-like environment.

== Description ==

Are your tired of switching back and forth between frontend and backend of your website? Or maybe you sometimes end up with too many browser tabs opened. If you are looking for a plugin to speed up your website management tasks and improve your efficiency, you've come to the right place.

= What's this plugin all about? =
The main goal of WindowPress is to keep everything organized and enclose all administration tasks in just one browser tab. This plugin achieves this by turning wp-admin into a desktop-like environment, in which you can open new windows with your website's internal pages. So for example in one browser tab you can view your website, customize it, add new content, manage comments, change settings etc. Clicking an adminbar or adminmenu link changes the location of the active window, which feels just like the normal WordPress administration area, however when you hold a click on a link, you will open it in a new window. Then you can easily switch between opened windows in the adminbar taskbar. 

= Admin menu sliding =
WindowPress adds a new feature to the admin menu (only for WindowPress admin area). You can hide admin menu and make it slide, so the pages in opened windows can be of full width. It can be easily turned on/off just like collapse menu feature.

= Flexibility =
WindowPress doesn't replace WordPress administration area. As you can see in the video, you can easily switch between WindowPress and traditional WordPress backend.

= Mobile support =
WindowPress works also on mobile devices, however please note that the mobile version may not work properly for you yet, as I only have one device to test it. If you find a bug please let me now in the support forum.

= Notice =
Make sure you always have the latest version of WindowPress before updating WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to open a new window? =

Simply hold a click on a link (or touch a link if it's a touch device) until a new window opens. The duration of this event can be changed in the settings (Long Press Duration).
